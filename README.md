# Network-Intrusion-Detection-using-machine-learning
 Studied the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the NSL-KDD dataset.  Also, tried the performance of the model in binary as well as in multiclass classification
Network Intrusion Detection system is a software application that monitors system and network for policy violations and malicious activity. Any type of violation is reported to the administrator or collected using (SIEM) security information and event management system. The SIEM system uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish false alarms from malicious activity. 
 
Even the intrusion detection system monitors network potentially but still they are disposed to false alarms. So, during installation organizations need to finely tune in their Intrusion detection system. Tuning in means properly setting up IDS to recognize what normal traffic looks like while filtering out malicious activity.
